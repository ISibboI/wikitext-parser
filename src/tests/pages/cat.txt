===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|cat}}, {{m|enm|catte}}, from {{inh|en|ang|catt||male cat}}, {{m|ang|catte||female cat}}, from {{inh|en|gmw-pro|*kattu}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*kattuz}}.
{{rel-top|Further etymology and cognates.}}
The Germanic word is generally thought to be from {{der|en|LL.|cattus||domestic cat}} (c. 350, [[w:Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]]), from {{der|en|la|catta}} (c. 75 {{small|A.D.}}, [[w:Martial|Martial]]),<ref>{{R:Etymonline}}</ref> from an {{der|en|afa}} language. This would roughly match how domestic cats themselves spread, as genetic studies suggest they began to spread out of the [[Near East]] / [[Fertile Crescent]] during the Neolithic (being in Cyprus by 9500 years ago,<ref name="ISample"/><ref name="COttoni"/> and Greece and Italy by 2500 years ago<ref>Dennis C. Turner, Patrick Bateson, ''The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour'' ({{ISBN|1107512212}}), page 93</ref>), especially after they became popular in Egypt.<ref name="ISample">Ian Sample, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/29/genetics.sciencenews DNA research identifies homeland of the domestic cat]'', in ''The Guardian'' (29 June 2007)</ref><ref name="COttoni">Claudio Ottoni, Wim Van Neer, Eva-Maria Geigl, et al, ''The palaeogenetics of cat dispersal in the ancient world'', in ''Nature: Ecology & Evolution'', volume 1 (19 June 2017) (doi: 10.1038/s41559-017-0139); summarized e.g. by [https://web.archive.org/web/20180516020404/http://blogs.plos.org/onscienceblogs/2017/06/23/where-did-cats-come-from/ PLOS]</ref> However, every proposed source word has presented problems. [[w:Adolphe Pictet|Adolphe Pictet]]<ref>{{R:ine:Pictet|vol=I|page=381}}</ref> and many subsequent sources refer to [[w:Barabra|Barabra]] (Nubian) {{m|onw|tr=kaddîska}} and "Nouba" ([[w:Nobiin language|Nobiin]]) {{m|fia|kadīs}} as possible sources or cognates,<ref>Otto Keller, ''Die antike Tierwelt'', vol. 1: ''Säugetiere'' (Leipzig, 1909), 75; Walther von Wartburg, ed. ''[[w:Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch|Französisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'', vol. 2 (Basel: R. G. Zbinden, 1922–1967), 520.</ref> but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian word is a loan from {{noncog|ar|قِطَّة}}.<ref name="Qitta">John Huehnergard, “Qitta: Arabic Cats”, in ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'', ed. Beatrice Gruendler (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 407–18.</ref> Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of {{cog|cop|ϣⲁⲩ||tomcat}} suffixed with feminine {{m|egy|-t}},<ref>Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. "[[chat]]" (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.</ref> but John Huehnergard says "the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested."<ref name="Qitta"/>

It may be a [[Wanderwort]].<ref>{{R:EWddS|ed=22|hw=Katze|362}}</ref> Kroonen says the word must have existed in Germanic from a very early date, as it shows morphological alternations, and suggests that it might have been borrowed from Uralic, compare {{noncog|se|gađfe||female stoat}} and {{noncog|hu|hölgy||stoat; lady, bride}} from {{noncog|urj-pro|*käďwä||female (of a fur animal)}}.<ref>{{R:gem:EDPG|*kattōn-}}</ref>
